This is just a simple todo app I've done because I've wanted to checkout Solid. TLDR: Solid is pretty awesome, so go try it! You can learn more on the [Solid Website](https://solidjs.com) or join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solidjs) if you're interested.

Deployed app can be found [here](https://todo.codenite.at)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
